There are a couple READMEs for this.

First I wrote one that I thought was helpful: [./BLOG_POST.md](./BLOG_POST.md)

Then I got kind of snippy about it and wrote this one, which has more code but I don't think is very helpful: [./SNIPPY.md](./SNIPPY.md)

Then I realized I was taking things too seriously and wrote [./STATIC_REFLECTION.md](./STATIC_REFLECTION.md) , but got sick for a few days and couldn't decide whether or not to share it. It's by far my favorite of the 3, but is a ~30-minute read, and consists almost entirely of BS.
